## Problem Overview
Conversational AI Chatbot

People often consume a wealth of information via videos, webinars, and podcasts but lack efficient ways to interact with or query specific information within these media. The challenge lies in converting long-form audio or video content into an interactive experience, allowing users to ask questions and retrieve precise information from the content without manually searching or listening through the entire file.

### Problem Statement
Develop a tool that transforms video or audio content into an interactive, conversational experience by transcribing audio, processing content for context, and providing accurate, real-time answers to user questions.

### Project Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
conda create -p env python=3.10 -y
```

#### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
```bash
conda activate env/
```

#### 4. Install Project Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

#### 5. Environment Variables
Create a .env file and add the required key-value pairs:
```bash
ASSEMBLY_AI_KEY = your_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY = your_secret_key
```

#### 6. How to Run the Project
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
